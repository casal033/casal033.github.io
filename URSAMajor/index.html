		<center><h2>What is URSA Major?</h2></center>
		<p> When Software Development students were given the task of making a website for the Undergraduate Research Symposium, they were also given the tough job of deciding what the website's design would be like, choosing what it would be named, and designing its capabilities. The goal of URSA Major is to be an organizational website that streamlines the reviewing process, and automates this process whenever possible. It does this to fluidly integrate all aspects of the URS, from submissions, to reviews, to the organizing of the entire event. </p>
		<center><h2>What is the Undergraduate Research Symposium?</h2></center>
		<p>The Undergraduate Research Symposium (URS) offers an opportunity for the UMM community to present research, creative work and art performances. The audience not only includes peers, faculty and family, but reaches far beyond the campus community. The URS continually manages to show the world what the UMM community can achieve. Because of it's abbreviation as URS, we decided to name the website including this acronym to get: URSA Major. This is also the name of a constellation that depicts a bear, which can be seen on URSA Major's home page. </p>

		<ul style="list-style: none;"> 
			<li> In My Directed Study: </li>
				<ul>
					<li> Worked with our clients to discuss their preferences and concerns. </li>
					<li> Created realistic data to test our system and demonstrate capabilities to our clients. </li>
					<li> At this point there was no test coverage, so I incorporated tests to existing functions. </li>
						<ul>
							<li> Our test coverage went from the initial give x% to about 90% covered by the end of the group's work. </li>
						</ul>
					<li> We also found several bugs that were left from previous work. 
						<ul>
							<li> One example of this was handling a new user's view when they have no submissions. </li>
							<li> We had a loading symbol that appears if you are waiting for submissions to be pulled from the database, this appeared for new users with no submissions. </li>
							<li> The first half of the directed study was adding testing coverage and fixing these bugs. </li>
						</ul>
					<li> Added a redirect for users with non-'umn' emails. This redirects those who do not have a umn email to our homepage. Here there is a note expliaining why the user cannot go further into the website. </li>
					<li> Added group change options, such as a search bar for name lookups and filters for groups. This was for the Chair or Admin to modify what groups Reviewers were assigned to review. </li>
