	<hh>Hi there, my name is Maggie Casale!</hh>
<div class="theBox">
	<p>	I'm currently a senior at the University of Minnesota, Morris and I'll be graduating this May, 2016. Since attending school, I live in Morris, MN. However, I have plans to move close to the twin cities after graduating. When I'm not working on projects or schoolwork I enjoy photography, traveling, and learning new games.
