	<hh>Hi there, my name is Maggie Casale!</hh>
<div class="theBox">
	<p>	I'm currently a senior at the University of Minnesota, Morris (UMM) and I'll be graduating this May, 2016. Since attending school, I live in Morris, MN. However, I have plans to move close to the twin cities after graduating. When I'm not working on projects or schoolwork I enjoy photography, traveling, and learning new games.

	<h2> Projects I've worked on: </h2>
	<font size = "5">
	<ul  style="list-style: none;"> 
		<li> Morris Academic Partnership with Professor Nic McPhee: <b> August 2015 - Current </b><li>
			<ul>
				<li> Using graph database tools (Neo4j, Titan, TinkerPop, Gremlin) to explore ancestries in evolutionary computation. </li>
				<li> Understanding how evolutionary tools such as selection, recombination, and mutation work together to construct novel improvements. </li>
				<li> From this research, I've presented about visualizing genetic programming ancestries using graph databases at the Undergraduate Research Symposium at UMM. </li>
				<li> I plan to attend the Genetic Programming Theory and Practice Workshop in May and present a viulization workshop at GEECO in July. </li>
				<li> Here are some interesting runs we've incorporated into papers and talks, we build these pdfs using Graphviz's dot: </li>
					<ul>
						<li> <a href="images/filtered_fill.pdf"> Example 1</a>:  A short run showing the ancestry tree of those who contributed instructions to the 'winning' program. This also highlights where important instructions are introduced.</li>
						<li> <a href="images/run0_dual_and_RBM_full.pdf"> Example 2</a>: The same short run shown in two different coloring styles. One highlights the progression of solving the problem. The other highlights individuals with similar test cases. </li>
						<li> <a href="images/run1_RBM_color_filtered_and_full_60000.pdf"> Example 3</a>: An ancestry tree of a successful run and a filtered version which eliminates parents who are very different from their child. </li>
						<li> <a href="images/runs_1_99_6_RBM_color_filtered3.pdf"> Example 4</a>: Multiple successful filtered runs, colors are based on similarity of test cases. </li>
						<li> <a href="images/runs_92_2_1_99_dual_color_full_better_18ft.pdf"> Example 5</a>: Failed and successful runs side-by-side. </li>
					</ul>

		<li> Senior Seminar: <b> Fall Semester 2015</b> </li>
			<ul>
				<li> Completed an in-depth survey of research literature in assistive technologies, focusing on touchscreen interaction for motor-impaired users. </li>
				<li> Analyzed various published works, synthesized their contents, and produced a six-page research paper on my work. This work was presented formally in a conference setting, December 5th. </li>
				<li> My Final Paper: <a href="Resume/CasaleCameraReadyPaper.pdf" title="paperPDF"> PDF </a></li>
			</ul> <hr>
		<li> Morris Academic Partnership with Professor K.K. Lamberty:<b> Summer 2015</b> </li>
			<ul>
				<li> Continued development on WordRiver & StoryBuilder, a MEAN stack website & iOS application. </li>
				<li> Redesigned layout of WordRiver interface and API models </li>
				<li> Modified StoryBuilder to access relevant information from WordRiver </li>
				<li> Presented demo of work at Interaction Design and Children conference in Boston, July 2015 </li>
				<li> Word River Website**: <a href="https://teacherwordriver.herokuapp.com/" title="Word River"> Word River </a> </li>
				<li> ** Note: This is in testing mode, simply click 'Submit' in the login area to continue. </li>

			</ul> <hr>
		<li> Directed Study: Web Design and Development: <b> Spring Semester 2015</b></li>
			<ul>
				<li> Continued development on URSA Major, a MEAN stack website for the University of Minnesota, Morris' Undergraduate Research Symposium. </li>
				<li> The project was started in my Software Design class, where we worked with faculty from the university to create a custom website.
				<li> <a href="/URSAMajor" title="URSAMajor">Click here </a> for more info about URSA Major. </li>
				<li> Kept group of five on task and organized. </li>
				<li> Added testing and error messages for development. </li>
				<li> Link to URSA Major (Please note, you will need a ".umn.edu" gmail to login.): <a href="https://ursa-major-project.herokuapp.com/" title="Ursa Major"> Ursa Major </a> </li>
